> "The mainframe is a maze. The commands are your map."

Retro Linux Terminal Adventure is an immersive "hacking" simulation. This **Simple No-AI Edition** provides a pure terminal experience, focused entirely on your ability to navigate systems and solve puzzles using authentic Linux commands.

## 🕹️ Core Mechanics

- **Procedural VFS**: No two hacking runs are the same.
- **Authentic Commands**: Support for `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `grep`, `pwd`, and more.
- **CRT Visuals**: High-fidelity retro-futuristic interface with scanline hardware emulation.
- **Pure Skill**: No AI hints or assistance. Just you and the command line.
