> "The mainframe is a maze. The commands are your map."

Retro Linux Terminal Adventure is an immersive, "hacking" simulation. Using a procedurally generated Virtual File System (VFS), players must navigate complex directory structures using real Linux commands to uncover secrets, recover data, and avoid detection.

## 🕹️ Core Mechanics (Intermediate)

- **Mechanical Entropy**: Investigate system files, logs, and traces to find your path.
- **Dynamic Security**: Passwords are no longer static—use advanced commands to sift through logs or decrypt locked security hints.
- **Procedural VFS**: A fully randomized Linux-style file system.
- **Authentic Commands**: Heavy support for `ls -a`, `cd`, `cat`, `grep`, `sudo`, `pwd`, and more.
- **AI-Driven Narrative**: Missions and hints generated by Google Gemini, now fully aware of intermediate hacking patterns.
- **CRT Visuals**: Immersive retro-futuristic interface with scanlines and glowing terminal text.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Investigator's Field Guide

Navigating the system requires more than just knowing command syntax; it requires a hacker's intuition.

### 1. The Cold Start
Every session begins in total silence. Your first task is to find a "Mechanical Hook." Don't expect a note on the desk. Investigate your environment—check communication logs, system configurations, and past activity traces. The system always leaves a footprint; find it.

### 2. Following the Fragments
Leads rarely point directly to the prize. They point to "Sectors." Once you arrive, you may need to look for what isn't visible at first glance. Use your tools to reveal hidden layers and secure restricted areas.

### 3. Gaining Elevation
Some secrets are locked behind `root` clearance. Credentials are rarely static. You might need to sift through massive data streams, reconstruct fragmented logs, or find ways to decrypt security prompts left behind by previous admins.

### 4. The Final Payoff
When you find your target, it might be shielded. Keep your decryption tools ready. Accessing the content of the objective file is your final proof of compromise.
